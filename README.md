# 11-3D-Game

This game is a work in progress. It is intended to be an exploration and coin collection game done via a third person perspective. Elements of the code are not working at the moment so you can't increase the player score but you can still explore. 

Music is from an album by Poppy called I C U (Music to read to) and I believe the track is called Centralize.
